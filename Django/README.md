## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

## Getting Started
Getting started is a piece of cake! üç∞ Follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository 

    ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/your-username/BlogPlatform.git
        cd BlogPlatform

### 2. Run the Application

## Environment Variables

The `.env` file contains sensitive information such as secret keys and database credentials. This file is crucial for configuring your Django application and ensuring its secure operation.üîí

‚ö†Ô∏è**Warning**‚ö†Ô∏è: Keep your .env file confidential, and do not share it publicly. Exercise caution to prevent unintentional exposure of sensitive information.
   
    ```bash
        # .gitignore
        .env

### Why .env?

- **Security:** Storing sensitive information like secret keys and database credentials in a separate `.env` file adds an extra layer of security. This helps in keeping your sensitive information confidential.

- **Configuration Management:** The `.env` file centralizes configuration variables, making it easier to manage and update your application's settings.

### Example .env File:

    ```bash
        # Change these values with your own secret key and database credentials
         SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
         DB_NAME=your-database-name
         DB_USER=your-database-user
         DB_PASSWORD=your-database-password
         DB_HOST=db
         DB_PORT=5432
